# Scripted Pixels

This is the new version of my portfolio and blog. It's a work in progress and I'm "building this in public" as I've wasted too much time not having any fresh content on my site for a few years.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run generate
```
