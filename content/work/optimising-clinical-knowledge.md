More information: The site was designed by [The Tiny Agency](http://www.thetinyagency.com "The Tiny Agency"). The use of Adobe Illustrator allowed us to scale the icons easily for high resolution displays.

The site was first constructed without WordPress integration. This allowed me to work out any issues with the site's responsive design. The menu's and blog were features that could have caused issues across devices and browsers.

The blog's mobile and desktop content is displayed differently. This was created with the use of hidden and shown elements via media queries. This had minimum impact on load times as WordPress calculates the data to be displayed once.

This website uses my [custom responsive grid](# "My custom responsive grid").
