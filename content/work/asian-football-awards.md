More information: The site was designed by[The Tiny Agency](https://www.thetinyagency.com "The Tiny Agency"). The use of Adobe Illustrator allowed us to scale the icons easily for high resolution displays.

The site was first constructed without WordPress integration. This allowed me to work out any issues with the site's responsive design. The carousels, menu and submission forms were features that could have caused issues across devices and browsers.

This website uses my [custom responsive grid](# "My custom responsive grid").
