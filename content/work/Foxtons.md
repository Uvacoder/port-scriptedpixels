Working in a dynamic in-house team within the estate agents' head office; I was able to understand how the team worked on many projects that were internal as well as the public facing website.

As I have an eye for design, I was able to build and manage the Foxtons Rare website's re-design. It was a site that showcased the quirky and very designer houses on the market.
