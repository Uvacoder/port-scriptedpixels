I maintained & improved the front-end for 3 Magento v1 stores: Ryman Stationery, Robert Dyas and London Graphic Centre. I introduced new HTML, JavaScript, React & CSS features and functionality as well as refactoring older templates to ensure one theme was used for all stores, following the parent - child relationship of Magento theming.

As lead Front-end/UI developer I also helped train developers to use newer CSS 3, HTML 5 & JavaScript features. I presented and advised to the business; best UI/UX practices, wireframes and designs for both the new checkout project on Ryman and Robert Days stores, as well as the new Magento store for the London Graphic Centre website.
