Having just graduated from Nottingham Trent University, I landed my 1st role as a full-time web developer at a small web agency in Dorking, Surrey.

This role involved many areas of building websites: interacting with clients, managing offshore developers, working with the Sales team as well as understanding SEO and how it worked.
