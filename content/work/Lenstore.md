As a front-end lead developer I managed and trained a team of developers. Planning a path for the front-end techstack as well as helping the junior and mid-weight developers up-skill. Ultimately training the team to be ready to implement new features for the website.

I was a part of a team that pushed business growth in the U.K and EU. Meeting the businessâ€™ 3 year growth plan.

I was involved with project planning, story creation, sprint planning and also communicating technical insight to product owners as well as stakeholders.
