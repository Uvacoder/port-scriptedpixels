At the beginning of my Web Career (2009) I started working for a small agency in Dorking called <strong>[Tempo Web design](http://www.tempowebdesign.co.uk)</strong>. I had just graduated from Nottingham Trent University, with a 2.1 in Multimedia, and had decided to make a big career switch from IT-support (team lead) to Web Developer/Designer.

This was the start of my journey to where I am now. Since this switch I’ve helped with:

- Responsive single page promotion websites
- Rebuilt and improved Magento frontends
- Implemented mobile first builds
- Created Wordpress thems for job-boards & portfolios
- Implemented Photoshop designs
- Created API driven widgets for Sky’s Twitter campaign during the Olympics
- and generally just worked within many agencies on multiple websites and accounts
