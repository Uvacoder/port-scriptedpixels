More information: Working via an agency based in Old Street, [Morph London](https://morphlondon.com/ "Morph London"), I was tasked to create a template for the new Piri Allergy website. This was to be cross browser compliant with fall-backs for older browsers where needed. I ensured all code was commented where needed and the CSS was split, in file, to the different pages as well as commented where needed.
