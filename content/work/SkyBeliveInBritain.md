More information: Working for a young agency, [Signal | Noise](https://www.signal-noise.co.uk "Signal | Noise"), based in Old Street I was asked to create a working prototype and ,then a final working twitter widget, for Sky Sports. The widget was used to measure the "twitter buzz" during the Olympics for the British athletes.

This widget was apart of a larger site that was built by various other agencies hired by Sky. I created 3 different size widgets, in landscape and portrait, that were controlled by the site's media queries via JavaScript.
