I am progressively updating the existing F.A.C.E JavaScript application from jQuery & JavaScript to Vue.js. I'm working with stakeholders and product owners to deliver high level wire-frames and designs for each new feature/change.

I'm scoping out user stories and their relative tech tasks as well as developing each feature and change. I've created a plan for the upgrade of the front-end and documented all changes and features.
